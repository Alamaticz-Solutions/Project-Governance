//! Single chokepoint for the framework runtime crate (backend framework
//! replacement phase 7, slice 1 -- docs/architecture/self-owned-backend-plan.md).
//!
//! Every other file in `backend/src` that still needs a type or function
//! from `appfw_runtime` reaches it through this module (`crate::platform::
//! runtime::...`) instead of naming the crate directly. This is a purely
//! mechanical rewiring -- no behavior change, and `appfw_runtime` itself is
//! still the real implementation underneath every re-exported name here.
//! The point is git-diff visibility during the port: `grep -rl
//! "appfw_runtime" backend/src --include='*.rs'` now returns exactly this
//! file, so later slices can see their own progress by watching this
//! module shrink (an item moves from `pub use appfw_runtime::Foo;` to a
//! self-owned `pub use crate::platform::foo::Foo;` line) instead of
//! grepping 45 files for a moving target.
//!
//! `backend/Cargo.toml` still declares the real `appfw_runtime` path
//! dependency -- this module doesn't remove it, later slices do, ending
//! with slice 8's final cutover once every re-export below has been
//! replaced by self-owned code.
